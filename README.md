# Optimizing-Supply-Chain-Efficiency-Using-Data-Analytics-and-AI-for-a-Beauty-Startup


## Project Description
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain efficiency for a beauty startup by addressing three critical business challenges:
1. **Shipment Delays**: Reducing transit times and improving logistics operations.
2. **Inventory Mismanagement**: Balancing stock levels to prevent overstock and stockouts.
3. **Rising Transportation Costs**: Identifying cost-effective transportation methods.

Leveraging advanced data analytics, machine learning models, and visualization tools, this project provides actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Shipment Delay Prediction**: Used Random Forest Regressor to predict lead times based on shipment type, transportation method, and historical delays.
- **Inventory Clustering**: Applied KMeans Clustering to identify regions with overstock or stockout risks, enabling better inventory distribution.
- **Transportation Cost Analysis**: Leveraged Logistic Regression to classify and optimize transportation methods based on cost and delay risk.
- **Actionable Visualizations**: Designed interactive Tableau dashboards for clear communication of insights and recommendations.

## Project Goals
1. Achieve a **30% improvement in lead times** by optimizing logistics.
2. Reduce stock imbalances by **20%** through predictive inventory planning.
3. Decrease transportation expenses by **15%** using AI-driven cost analysis.
